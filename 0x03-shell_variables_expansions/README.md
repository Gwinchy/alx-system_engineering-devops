When you type the command $ ls -l *.txt in the shell, the following happens:

The shell interprets the command as "ls" followed by the "-l" option and the "*.txt" argument.
The shell expands the "*.txt" argument into a list of filenames ending with ".txt" in the current directory.
The expanded list of filenames is passed as arguments to the "ls" command.
The "ls" command is executed with the "-l" option and the list of filenames.
The output of the "ls" command is displayed, showing detailed information about the files with the ".txt" extension.
Shell Initialization Files:

The /etc/profile file is a system-wide initialization script executed for login shells. It sets up environment variables and defines system-wide settings.
The /etc/profile.d directory contains additional initialization scripts that are sourced by the /etc/profile file. It allows system administrators to add customizations without modifying the main /etc/profile file.
The ~/.bashrc file:

The ~/.bashrc file is a user-specific initialization script for the Bash shell.
It is executed for non-login interactive shells, such as when you open a new terminal window.
It is typically used to customize the user's shell environment, define aliases, functions, and set up user-specific preferences.
Variables:

Local variables are defined and accessible within a specific scope, such as within a function or a script.
Global variables are defined and accessible throughout the entire shell session.
Local variables take precedence over global variables with the same name when accessed within the same scope.
Reserved variables:

Reserved variables are predefined variables with special meanings in the shell.
Examples of reserved variables include $HOME (the user's home directory), $PATH (the search path for commands), and $PS1 (the primary prompt string).
Creating, updating, and deleting shell variables:

To create a shell variable, you can use the assignment syntax: VARNAME=value.
To update the value of a variable, you can reassign a new value to it using the same syntax.
To delete a shell variable, you can use the unset command followed by the variable name: unset VARNAME.
Roles of the following reserved variables:

$HOME stores the path to the user's home directory.
$PATH contains a colon-separated list of directories where the shell searches for executable files.
$PS1 determines the primary prompt string displayed in the shell.
Special parameters:

Special parameters are variables that hold specific values or have special meanings in the shell.
Examples include $0 (the name of the shell or script), $1, $2, etc. (positional parameters), and $? (the exit status of the previous command).
The special parameter $?:

$? holds the exit status of the most recently executed command.
It is often used to check the success or failure of the previous command in scripts or to control conditional logic.
Expansions:

Expansions are mechanisms in the shell that allow variables, wildcards, and other constructs to be expanded or replaced with their values.
Examples of expansions include variable expansion ($VARNAME), command substitution ($(command) or `command`), and arithmetic expansion ($((expression))).
Difference between single and double quotes:

Single quotes (') preserve the literal value of each character within the quotes. Variables and command substitutions are not expanded.
Double quotes (") allow variables and command substitutions to be expanded within the quotes.
Command substitution with $() and backticks:

Command substitution is a way to capture the output of a command and use it as part of another command or assign it to a variable.
The recommended syntax for command substitution is $(). For example: result=$(command).
Backticks (`) can also be used for command substitution, but they are less preferred due to potential quoting issues.
Shell arithmetic:

The shell can perform arithmetic operations using the $((expression)) syntax.
For example, you can add two numbers with sum=$((num1 + num2)) or perform more complex arithmetic operations using operators like +, -, *, /, and %.
